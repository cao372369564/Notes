    An empty street!            An empty house!
    A hole inside my heart !    I'm all alone 
    The rooms are getting smaller!
    I wonder how                I wonder why 
    I wonder why they are
    The days we had             The songs we sang together 
    Oh yeah

    And all my love
    We're holding on forever
    Reaching for the love that seems so far

    So I say a little praper
    Hope my dreams will take me there
    Where the skies are blue
    To see you once again ,  my love
    Over seas from coast to coast
    Find the place I love the most
    Where the fields are green
    To see you once again------mylove
